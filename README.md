# GraphMask

This repository will contain the code for our ICLR 2021 paper [Interpreting Graph Neural Networks for NLP With Differentiable Edge Masking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00577). We are currently in the process of cleaning the code, and we will update the repository with the release as soon as possible.
